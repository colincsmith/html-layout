        <p> The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it -- and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.

            And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country.
            
            My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.</p>
